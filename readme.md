# 🐍 Python Interview Prep

Welcome! This repository contains problem questions and solutions I practiced in preparation for a technical interview involving **Python coding (without AI assistance)**.

## ✅ Topics Practiced

- ✅ Variables, loops, and conditionals
- ✅ List manipulation
- ✅ String operations
- ✅ Dictionaries and sets
- ✅ Recursion
- ✅ Edge cases and clean code practices
- ✅ Interview-style logic problems

## 🎯 Goal

To become confident solving **basic to intermediate-level Python problems** independently, under real interview conditions (no AI assistance, no external help).

## 🧠 Approach

- Solved each problem manually first
- Requested feedback only _after_ attempting a solution
- Focused on clean, readable, and efficient code
- Practiced reasoning through edge cases
